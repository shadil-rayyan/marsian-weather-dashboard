# Mars Weather Dashboard

Welcome to the **Mars Weather Dashboard**! This project aims to visualize and analyze weather data from NASAâ€™s InSight Mars lander, providing insights into Martian weather patterns and the challenges of data collection on Mars.

## Project Idea

The Mars Weather Dashboard is a web application designed to display real-time and historical weather data from the InSight Mars lander. It allows users to:

- View current and historical weather data on Mars.
- Compare weather conditions over the last 7 Martian days (Sols).
- Visualize data trends and analyze weather patterns.
- Receive alerts for significant weather events such as dust storms or extreme temperature changes.

## Reason & Importance

Understanding Martian weather is crucial for planning future missions to Mars and for managing resources effectively on the Red Planet. This project helps to:

- Provide a user-friendly interface for exploring complex Martian weather data.
- Aid researchers and enthusiasts in understanding how weather conditions impact the InSight lander and its operations.
- Educate the public about Mars' climate and the challenges faced by scientific missions on the planet.

## How It Will Help Us

This dashboard will:

- Offer real-time insights into Martian weather conditions, helping researchers make informed decisions about mission planning.
- Enhance public interest and awareness of space exploration and planetary science.
- Serve as a prototype for future space weather applications and educational tools.
